# Currency-Converter
A money exchange calculator using Vanilla JS and bootstrap and font-awesome.

In this Project, we are consuming the https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/{Currency} API and calculating the currency rates from one to other.
We can interchange from currency and To currency as well, for that an excange icon(font-awesome) can be seen in the middle of the below img.

Ex: If currency you need to convert is from USD to INR or INR to EUR, you can interchange the calculations as INR to USD and EUR to INR respectively.

Have added almost 50 currencies and you can calculate the exchange rates from this.
